      <h1 style="color: red;">Mitsubishi Lancer</h1>
      <h2 style="color:red">How do you prefer to achieve your expectations?</h2>
      <h3 style="color:white">Very diverse, you will fulfil any of your desires and surpass whatever you have been waiting for in a car of its class. Its high-tech advantages alone will impress you, until you discover how easy it is to explore these advantages. If music is what you want, its sound system will captivate your ears. If you prefer performance, Lancer provides you with everything, from economics to great performance. Why do you limit your expectations? With Lancer, you will always be amazed by the way you wish</h3>

        <h1 style="color:red">Abroad</h1>
        <h2 style="color:red">You think she can't resist? Look again</h2>
        <h3 style="color: white;">Approach it and scrutinise it, its design will captivate you, but its appeal is more than just a design. All Lancer models carry the spirit of the Evolution model. The solid and unique construction of its design gives it the strength to handle high-performance driving. While it has great flow, it is also practical, with its high wide roof and wide ass. So once you're done staring, you'll find it easier to enter it.</h3>
        <img src="Mitsubishi-Lancer-05.jpg">
        <h2 style="color:red">Storage space</h2>
        <h3 style="color:white">The new Lancer offers a large and comfortable rear storage space, providing up to 351 litres of storage capacity. The back cover has been redesigned with side joints to provide more efficient use of the space and avoid it from colliding with your luggage. For added convenience, you can access luggage from inside the cabin through the possibility of folding the back seat at a ratio of 40:60. With the addition of the ground luggage compartment, the trunk area is shortened to a capacity of 315 litres.</h3>
        <img src="Mitsubishi-Lancer-03.jpg">
        <h1 style="color:red">Performance</h1>
        <h2 style="color:red">Engine and transmission</h2>
        <h3 style="color:white">However you choose your driving mode, you will inevitably feel the pure pleasure of the rally races inspired by the new Lancer design. It's in the roar of the rising power under the engine, and the wonderful smoothness of the CVT transmission when it moves up or down. Once Lancer speaks to you, you will immediately understand.</h3>
        <img src="Mitsubishi-Lancer-01.jpg">
        <h1 style="color:red">1.6-litre engine with MIVEC technology</h1>
        <h3 style="color:white">The 1.6-litre engine gives you a boost of concentrated excitement, where enough power for sports performance has been put wherever you have the opportunity to test it. Just like its great cousin, the engine also provides an aluminum head for improved efficiency, and MIVEC technology for more offensive start and maximum power.</h3>

        <h1 style="color:red">Inside</h1>
        <h2 style="color:red">Enjoy sitting as if you were at home</h2>
        <h3 style="color:white">It's really unfortunate when the design is so wonderful and you can't always look at it. The Lancer dashboard is engineered by placing each control exactly where you expect it to be. Gearshift arms and volume control buttons have also been added to the steering wheel to give you the full control you want without the need to take your gaze off the road ahead.</h3>
