              <b>Breakthrough Design</b>
              <Br>
                DB9 launched to acclaim in 2003 at the Frankfurt Motor Show with a Volante following in 2004.
                 Powered by a V12 engine, 
                 this was also the first Aston Martin to be developed on the VH (Vertical / Horizontal) Platform which underpinned all Gaydon produced cars.

              <br>
              <br>
              <br>
              Following iterations of DB9 continued to improve the Aston Martin flagship.
               A powerful AM11 V12 engine increased power to 517 ps, with torque of up to 620 NM. 
               Advanced carbon ceramic brakes gave DB9 a better response with a longer life, as well as improved performance with virtually no fade.

          <h3> VANQUISH </h3>
             <Br>
              <br>
           
                <i> About </i>
                The third-generation Vanquish is a front-engine, 
                rear-wheel drive cruiser with an aluminum structure, low roofline, and signature side strake.
                 Designers made this beauty longer, wider, and with a larger grille to give it more presence. 
                 It has a longer wheelbase and front overhang but shorter nose and chopped off rear with four exhausts.
                  The carbon fiber shield on the back can be body color or contrast. 
                 <br>
                 <br>
                <B> Crazy Decision to Make a New V-12</b>
                  <br>
                  The special sauce is the 5.2-liter twin-turbo V-12 that snorts out 824 horsepower with 738 lb-ft of torque,
                   distributed via a ZF eight-speed automatic transmission,
                    achieving a top speed of 214 mph. The team knew they needed a big leap in power to exceed today’s powerful V-8s,
                     but it had to meet the latest emissions regulations globally.
              <br>
              <br>

              <i> More Elegance Inside </i>
              <br>
              Appreciation for a sill that does not impede the ability to get in and out easily.
               Inside the cabin was redesigned to be more open, with a lower center console and a modest and discrete 10.3-inch touchscreen,
                as well as hard buttons for many functions. There is also a 10.3-inch driver display.  

Our evaluation vehicle had a dark gray and black interior with suede pillars and headliner,
 lots of carbon fiber on the door and dash, with black leather and metal trim,
  and a classy button with the brand logo for start/stop and to dial up the different drive modes.
   The gearshift is also in the center console and slides forward like an airplane throttle.
    There are toggle switches for climate control and more buttons for stability control,
     the exhaust boost, auto hold, parking assist, and the heated seats.
      One conspicuously missing button: volume control. You can use the steering wheel toggle or the touchscreen.   

The quilted, perforated leather sport seats are comfortable and easy to adjust to a good seating position via the controls to the right of your knee on the side of the center console. Behind the seat is just enough room for a purse and briefcase.  

The Vanquish is the fourth model to get the infotainment system that Aston Martin created inhouse, from scratch.
 It is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. There ae USB ports and a phone charger in the covered center console,
  along with a slot for the key fob and a power outlet.
