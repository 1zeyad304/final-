        <p id="history-p">
    Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Karl Benz's first internal
     combustion engine in a car, seen in the Benz Patent-Motorwagen financed by 
     Bertha Benz's dowry and patented in January 1886 and Gottlieb Daimler
     and their engineer Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition
     of a petrol engine, introduced later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first 
     marketed in 1901 by Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).

    Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, an Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG, regist
     ered the trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter Mercedes Jellinek.
    Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted "horseless" Daimler automobiles
     among the highest circles of society. At the time, it was a meeting place for the haute volée of
    France and Europe, especially in winter. His customers included the Rothschild family and other 
     wealthy clients, but as early as 1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World" as well, including to
    billionaires Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race he attended in 1899, 
    Jellinek drove under the pseudonym "Monsieur Mercédès". Many consider that race the birth of Mercedes-Benz as a brand.
    In 1901, the name "Mercedes" was re-registered by DMG worldwide as a protected trademark. The first Mercedes-Benz 
     branded vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the
     Daimler-Benz company on 28 June of the same year.
    Gottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith and working in France, 
     he attended the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After completing various technical activities
     in France and England, he started working as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863, he was 
    appointed workshop inspector at a machine-tool factory in Reutlingen, where he met Wilhelm Maybach in 1865.</p>
